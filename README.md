### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Frank, welcome on my page

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer from Switzerland currently working [@foodprint](https://github.com/frankperler/foodprint). In a former life, I was finance manager at a US medtech company (Masimo).

I love designing and creating applications from the ground up. I also have strong interest in blockchain technology whether it is creating smart contracts with Solidity or building front-ends with Web3.js.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing football, running, swimming and all sports in general. I am always curious to learn new technologies.

## What I am doing now?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on polishing the foodprint. web app using React and Typescript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and continue improving my skills with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/index.html#)
